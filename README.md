# Hello :wave:

I am Ayush. I am an economist working at the intersection of data, public policy, and development.  As an [RStudio Certified Tidyverse Instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/patel+ayush/), I enjoy teaching data analysis and its applications using R. I work with multiple organisations conducting research and analysis. With the [Oxford Poverty and Health Institute (OPHI)](https://ophi.org.uk/) housed at the University of Oxford, I visualise data and develop dashboards using the Multidimensional Poverty Indices (MPI). With Mercatus Centre at George Mason University, I work on developing a web application to show inflection points in India's economic growth and creating interactive visualizations for the same. Previously, I worked with elected representatives and state government officials researching rights-based laws for implementation and monitoring of welfare programs particularly targeted towards tribals in the state of Maharashtra. I also have experience in conducting experimental field research. 

# R package üì¶

My colleagues (Sabina Alkire, Usha Kanagaratnam and Nicolai Suppa) at OPHI estimate and create the [Global Multidimensional Poverty Index](https://ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/). This data bank is released every year with an update. Last year we shifteed from a tableau based dashboard to a shiny web application for the CI/CD benefits and reproducibility. I created this Shiny dashboard using the [golem framewok](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/). The primary reasons for chosing the golem framework are the structure it provides for development and maintaing the software, its ability to be shared as a R package and to share the code publically. The web application is named [OPHI Data Bank - Global Comparisons](https://trainingidn.shinyapps.io/OPHIDataBankGlobalComparison/) and it is hosted on the shinyapps.io platform with the help of [Interactive Data Network](https://idn.it.ox.ac.uk/home) at the univeristy of Oxford. The developpment of this application is still ongiong and the code is available on this [repo](https://github.com/AyushBipinPatel/OPHIDataBankGlobalComparison).

# Trainings and Workshops üë®‚Äçüè´

Though I have provided trainings on various applications of R, data visualization, literate programing using RMarkdown/Quarto and functional programming are the topics that I find most interesting to teach. Following are some of the training materials that I have used recently:

+ [Workshop on Data Visualization using R](https://r-iisa2022.rbind.io/) at the [International Indian Statistical Association (IISA) Annual Conference, 2022](https://www.intindstat.org/conference2022/index) held at IISc Bangalore. _[Workshop Landing Page](https://ayushbipinpatel.github.io/iisa-2022-viz-workshop/)_ | _[Slides](https://ayushbipinpatel.github.io/iisa-2022-viz-workshop/lecture_slides.html#/title-slide)_
+ Workshops on R for Data Analysis ‚Äë Aug 2021 offered at juspay, a start up working on payments solutions. The was a 20 hour training course covering introduction to R, data wrangling, visualization, reporting using RMarkdown, functional programming and intro to shiny appplications. _[Workshop Landing page](https://ayushbipinpatel.github.io/R-for-Data-Analysis/)_
+ A module on Using R for Data Analysis ‚Äë Apr 2021 as a part of Research Methodology Workshop organised by [Council of Social Development](https://csdindia.org/). The 9 hour training module was split across 6 lectures covering introduction to R, data Wrangling, basics of Data Visualization, creating Maps(Choropleths) in R, How to: Hypothesis testing and Linear Regression in R, and intro to Text Analysis. _[Workshop Landing Page](https://ayushbipinpatel.github.io/CSD-Workshop-for-Programming-in-R/)_
